                represented by our profile picture. This way, students are able to face one of their biggest nightmares
                in

                We have started from the idea that we would like a simple interface in which the main point is for the
                players to get to the game as fast as possible. We did respect that, but we have also added a few other
                pages, like History and Rules. There is also a Contact page if you ever feel the need to reach us.
                There have been ups and downs and a lot of changes during the first phases of development, but overall
                we
                think that we've done a good job on having a layout that is fast, good on the eye and also easy to
                understand and easy to navigate.<br>

            <p>
                Client data is stored on a database accessed in a easy manner by us developers on our back-end module.
                As a consequence of using an external website for our users to log on our application, we have to
                execute calls on external APIs, such as:
                <link property="itemListUnorder" href="https://schema.org/ItemListUnordered" />
                <ul role="directory">
                    <li property="itemListElement" typeof="ListItem">
                        Facebook API for developers - <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Here</a>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                In the next segment, we will talk about how we are going to use the Facebook API in order to
                authenticate into our website using your Facebook profile. <br><br>
                The Facebook SDK for JavaScript doesn't have any standalone files that need to be downloaded or
                installed, instead you simply need to include a short piece of regular JavaScript in your HTML that
                will asynchronously load the SDK into your pages. The async load means that it does not block loading
                other elements of your page.
                The following snippet of code will give the basic version of the SDK where the options are set to their
                most common defaults. You should insert it directly after the opening "body" tag on each page you want
                to load it:
                <br>
                <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img class="imagine" src="fbCode.png">
                </figure><br>
                This code will load and initialize the SDK. You must replace the value in your-app-id with the ID of
                your own Facebook App. You can find this ID using the App Dashboard.
                <br>
                Next, we would like our users to be able to login/register using Facebook login (another developer
                tool). To do that, we simply run the following code: <br>
                <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img class="imagine" src="fbCode_2.png">
                </figure>
                <b>Firebase API</b><br>
                After all, we have used Firebase API to be able to authenticate using external platforms logins
                (Facebook, Google, Github). <br>
                An easy guide for doing so was already well written on Firebase's main website.

        </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The concept of client-side storage has been around for a long time. Since the early days of the web,
                sites have used cookies to store information to personalize user experience on websites.
                They're the earliest form of client-side storage commonly used on the web.
                Because of that age, there are a number of problems — both technical and user experience-wise —
                afflicting cookies.
                These problems are significant enough that upon visiting a site for the first time, people living in
                Europe are shown messages informing them if they will use cookies to store data about them.
                This is due to a piece of European Union legislation known as the EU Cookie directive. Nowadays,
                WebStorage and IndexedDB is the way to go.
                The Web Storage API provides a very simple syntax for storing and retrieving smaller, data items
                consisting of a name and a corresponding value.
                This is useful when you just need to store some simple data, like the user's name, whether they are
                logged in, what color to use for the background of the screen, etc.
                The IndexedDB API provides the browser with a complete database system for storing complex data. This
                can be used for things from complete sets of customer records to even complex data types like audio or
                video files.
                While there is the Cache API that promises way better techniques of storing information on the
                client-side, it is not yet supported by many browsers and such, we will be using WebStorage and
                IndexedDB.

            <p>
                As we like to bring diversity to the player's experience, we could not escape the need to generate
                diverse and fun maps.
                <br>
                In the singleplayer mode, the player has the honour to take a walk in the classic UAIC University Corp
                C hallways, in the Faculty of Computer Science.
                <br><br>
                These are the hallways maps. Each one represents a certain hallway in the building, such as floor 2 (as
                Year 1), floor 3 (as Year 2)
                and floor 7 (as Year 3).
                <br>
                <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img class="imagine" src="years.png">
                </figure>
                <br><br>
                Other maps are shown randomly when the player enters a room. What we know for sure about these maps is
                that
                they have no dead-ends, they are symmetrically generated for left and right sections, for each
                different top, bottom, side
                and center sections and that they have two exit portals connected to one another.
                <br><br>
                The generation of the maps begins with an empty matrix representing half of the final map in which we
                start adding pairs of blocks
                in four rounds: top section, bottom section, sides section and center section.
